# Robotics_And_OOP
This repository has project for displaying c++ and OOP concepts and utilizing it for path planning
## C++ and OOP concepts 
In this project we have used the following concepts of c++ and OOP:
### Class
A class in C++ is the building block, that leads to Object-Oriented programming. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
### Objects
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated. 
### Abstract Class
A class that has atleast one pure virtual function, is an Abstract Class. 
Generally, abstract class is used as the base class in inhertance, a class derived form abstract class must define pure virtual function else it would also be a abstract class and we cannot create objects out of it.
### Access Specifiers
### Constructors 
### Destructor
### Setters and Getter Methods
### Inheritance   
### Virtual Functions 
### Function Overloading 
### Smart Pointers

## Code Documentation 
Doxygen is a code documneting tool.A C or C++ style comment block with some additional markings is done so that doxygen knows it is a piece of structured text that needs to end up in the generated documentation. The next section presents the various styles supported by doxygen.
